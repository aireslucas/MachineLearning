# Activity 01
**Study of Classification Problem and Data Manipulation**

*Notebook: Atividade01_db02.ipynb* 

  + Selecting a dataset *("Heart-Disease-App": https://github.com/maxim-eyengue/Heart-Disease-App)*
  
  + Preparation of a dataset, manipulating categorical and numerical data;
  
  + Spliting a dataset in train, validation and test data;

  + Model configuration for traning;
  
  + Classification problem;
  
  + Metrics (accuracy, precision and recall, true and false positive rates) usage to observe the results.

# Final Project - Part I
**Study of Multiclass Classification Problem (3+)**

*Notebooks:*
  *Study_week11.ipynb*
  *Multiclass_pt1_Lucas_Aires.ipynb*

  1) First step - *Study_week11.ipynb*:
     + Testing the algorithm by changing the number of features, to see how it effects the results of training;
     + Changing the blocks of processing to see its effects (we observed a problem, because of the image size);
  2) Second step - *Multiclass_pt1_Lucas_Aires.ipynb*:
     + Selecting a dataset of images, for multiclass classfication problem *(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alsaniipe/flowers-multiclass-datasets)*;
     + Data preparation;
     + Dropout test;
     + Fancier Model;
     + Case of Study;
     + Model Training and Metrics
